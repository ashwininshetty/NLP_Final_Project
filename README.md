# NLP_Final_Project

1. Create a virtual environment.
2. Enter the virtual environment and pip install -r requirements.txt.
3. Open the folder on Jupyter Labs.
3. Run the Data_pre_Process.ipynb
4. Then run the Model_And_Evaluation.ipynb

Note: We have saved the models and encoded files so to save time you can skip cells 26-30(Bert and Tfidf embeddings in Data_Pre_Process file) and skip cells 25 and 26 in Model_And_Evaluation file
