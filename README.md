# NLP-Powered Surveillance Against Online Hate

## Dataset

 We have provided the dataset, namely train.csv and test.csv. We pulled it from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arkhoshghalb/twitter-sentiment-analysis-hatred-speech).

## Installing Libraries

We have created a requirements.txt for all the packages that you require. Please run `pip install -r requirements.txt` on the directory.

## Steps to run the project:

    1. Create a virtual environment.
    2. Enter the virtual environment and pip install -r requirements.txt.
    3. Open the folder on Jupyter Labs.
    4. Run the Data_pre_Process.ipynb


Note: We have saved the models and encoded files so to save time you can skip cells 26-30 [Bert and Tfidf embeddings in Data_Pre_Process file]. And skip cells 25 and 26 in Model_And_Evaluation file

This [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NfSgo_bToLlQFIieKoXUuI6rw63bhYzT?usp=sharing) has BERT and TF IDF encoded train and test tweets.
